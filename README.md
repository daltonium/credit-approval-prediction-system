# Credit Card Approval Prediction System

A machine learning system that predicts credit card approval decisions with fairness-aware modeling and an interactive prediction interface.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for credit card approval prediction using the UCI Credit Approval dataset. The system includes data preprocessing, multiple model training, fairness auditing, and a user-friendly prediction interface.

### Key Features
- ✅ **89.37% prediction accuracy** (XGBoost model)
- ✅ **Fairness-aware ML** with bias mitigation
- ✅ **5 trained models** for comparison (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- ✅ **Interactive prediction interface** with real-time credit decisions
- ✅ **Comprehensive evaluation** (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
